Message Descriptions

Basic message format

[:<prefix>] <COMMAND> [<param>] [:<text>]
a message can have a prefix, which contains no whitespace. this is often used
for telling clients from who a message originated.

errors, as well as certain types of replies, are identified by number, so the
message looks like
[:<prefix>] 000 [<param>] :error/reply message


PASS <password>
    authenticates a client, must be done before any messages can be posted.
    should be sent before one of USER or NICK
    REPLIES:
        ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS -- 461 <command> :Not enough parameters
        ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED -- 462 :You may not reregister

NICK <nickname>
    Sets a clients display name to %nickname. if the name is already in use,
    drop this message and respond with error 436 (don't know how this works,
    or if it's entirely required)
    REPIES:
        ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN -- 431 :No nickname given
        ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME -- 432 <nick> :Erroneus nickname

        ERR_NICKCOLLISION -- 436 <nick> :Nickname collision KILL // maybe not used?

USER <username> <hostname> <servername> <realname>

    before a user can send messages.
