Message Descriptions

PASS password
    authenticates a client, must be done before any messages can be posted.
    should be sent before one of USER or NICK

NICK nickname
    Sets a clients display name to %nickname. if the name is already in use,
    drop this message and respond with error 436 (don't know how this works,
    or if it's entirely required)

USER username hostname servername realname
    mostly useless information to us, but should be stored, and is required
    before a user can send messages.

KICK channel user [comment]
    remove %user from %channel if the client sending the message has operator
    in %channel. send back a response of what the server did?
